## A [shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io/) app for exploring machine learning  

-  The app can be found [here](https://jmmark.shinyapps.io/exploreML/)  
-  The user can build different machine learning models on three built-in datasets  
-  Model training is done using the 'caret' package in R  
-  Inputs are constrained and documented so user can  
  -  Edit training choices and see the impact
  -  Not be overwhelmed by the available choices
-  Model results are shown to the user in real-time

## Introducing novices to machine learning  

-  Machine learning is more useful and talked about now than ever
-  More and more people are becoming interested
-  Many resources available describing it, but hands-on exploration can be difficult
  -  Knowedlge of coding
  -  Finding data
  -  Understanding outputs  
  -  Time required  
-  With this app, novices can learn by playing with nothing more than a web browser
-  The app handles all of the data processing, data partitioning, model training, and generating outputs so the user can immediately see the impact of their choices
-  Enough documentation is provided with the app so the user can understand what is going on but is purposely minimal to encourage the user to learn through experimenting

## Inputs and outputs offer many options, but for simplicity are not exhausive

### Inputs

-  Dataset
  -  3 built-in binomial classification datasets
  -  Alzheimer, German Credit, or Cell Segmntation
-  Model Method
  -  4 choices--2 linear, 2 tree
  -  GLM, Boosted GLM, Tree, Random Forest
-  Pre-processing predictors (PCA only)
-  Resampling / Cross-Validation method
  -  Bootstrap, K-Fold CV, or Repeat K-Fold
  -  Number of resamples
  -  Repeat ed resamples, if needed
-  Fraction of data to allocate to train vs test
-  Random Seed

***  =right
  
### Outputs

-  Basic Summary Info
  -  Training time
  -  Estimated trainning out-of-sample accuracy and kappa
  -  Actual test accuracy and kappa
-  R output of trained model
-  Graph of accuracy and kappa from resamples
-  Confusion matrix on the test set

## Still, the app is flexible enough for deeper insights  

For example, the user might find that more complex models (higher train times) do not always result in better performance
<img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<p style="font-size:12px">Note, this is not a direct output from the app but rather a summary generated by R of some models that can be explored using the app.  This example uses the data GermanCredit, all predictors, a 70/30 trainning split, 10-fold cross-validation, no pre-processing and a random seed of 1416.  Code has been suppressed but can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jmmark/DevDataProducts" target="_blank">this repo</a></p>
